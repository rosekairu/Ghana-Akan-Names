## Description
Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. 
This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
* Enter your birthday through the form 
* Choose your gender.
* Click the submit button to see what your Akan name would be.
